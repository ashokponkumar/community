Move2Kube plugins for VS Code/Eclipse:
--------------------------------------

[Move2Kube](https://github.com/konveyor/move2kube) allows developers to create Kubernetes artifacts for their projects. It allows for multiple interfaces including command line and Web UI. 

One other natural extension of Move2Kube is to have VS Code and Eclipse plugins. These plugins should allow easy creation of kubernetes artifacts for the project that is currently open.

The activity can be done in stages:

Stage 1:
  Allow users to right click on docker-compose.yaml file, and select option to invoke Move2Kube and generate Kubernetes artifacts.

Stage 2:
  Allow users to right click on any project, and select option to invoke Move2Kube. This should allow for an interactive UI to generate Kubernetes artifacts relevant to that project.
